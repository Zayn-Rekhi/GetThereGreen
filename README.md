# GetThereGreen - Our Solution to Air Pollution

GetThereGreen is an interactive simulation where users can see the effects of society's commute to work on the quality of our air for the new 10 years.

## Machine Learning

We used Tensorflow/Keras in order to create 4 highly accurate model (Multi-Layer Perceptron) that predicts the concentration of Sulfur Dioxide, Nitrogen Dioxide, 
Carbon Monoxide, and Surface Level Ozone. The input data that wes used was acquired from the US Census data database under the specific header of ***B08301***. The
air quality data was acquired from the EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) and is used as the labels for our training data.
